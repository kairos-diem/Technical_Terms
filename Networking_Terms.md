<h2> Terms & Definitions </h2>

1. Endpoints - Any devices that are used to connect to the network.
2. Servers - The computers or systems like google which take the request from the client and does the appropriate action to get the desired result.
3. OSI and TCP/IP model - OSI is the 7 layer model which is used to understand how a networking application works. TCP/IP model is a much more simplified version with 4 layers.
4. IP address - These are a set of numbers which uniquely identify a system on the network. They can be either IPv4 or IPv6.
5. Ports - They are responsible for receiving the appropriate packets according to the protocols that are being used. Might also be reffered as IPv4 sockets.
6. DNS - Domain naming system is responsible for translating domain names into specific IP address.
7. TCP Handshake - https://www.guru99.com/tcp-3-way-handshake.html
8. SSL Handshake - https://www.ssl.com/article/ssl-tls-handshake-overview/
9. Types of DNS records: <br/>
  a. A record - Indicates the ip address. <br/>
  b. AAAA record - Indicates the IPv6 address. <br/>
  c. CNAME record - Indicates the canonical name or the domain name associated with it. <br/>
  d. NS record - Indicates the authoritative DNS server to look to find the particular domain address to the ISP.<br/>
  e. MX record - Indicates the mail exchange record and directs the incoming mail of the domain. <br/>
10. Multiplexing - Sending multiple signals in a single channel.
11. TCP - Transmission control protocol is used for connection-oriented, reliable delivery and flow control situations. Think of website surfing.
12. UDP - User Datagram Protocol is used for connectionless, unreliable delivery and no flow control is required. Think of brodcasting or streaming.
13. Common Ports <br/>
  a. port 23 - Telnet - clear text remote login. <br/>
  b. port 22 - SSH - Encrypted remote login. <br/>
  c. port 25 - SMTP - Sending mail. <br/>
  d. port 53 - DNS - Domain name to IP address. <br/>
  e. port 20 - FTP - File transfers. <br/>
  f. port 80 - HTTP - web server. <br/>
  g. port 443 - HTTPS - encrypted web server. <br/>
  h. port 3389 - RDP - Remote Desktop protocol. <br/>
  i. port 445 - SMB - Shared file. <br/>
14. MAC address - Physical address associated with each device. Media Access Conrol address.
15. Duplex - Sending and receiving data simultaneously.
16. Switch - A device used to forward or drop frames to devices rather than networks, it also updates the list of MAC addresses and maintain a loop free environment.
17. Unicasts - one to one communication. Web browsing, file transfer and so on. 
18. Broadcast - one to all communication. Limited scope, IPv4, radio, newsletter.
19. Multicast - one to many not all communication. Multimedia delivery, stock exchanges and so on.
20. Network trunk - A communications line or link designed to carry multiple signals simultaneously to provide network access between two points.
21. Tunneling - A way to send private communication packets through public networks by way of encapsulation.
22. Tagged and Untagged VLANs - A tagged VLAN is used to pass data to other/multiple VLAN networks and untagged VLAN is used to access a single VLAN.
23. IGP - Interior Gateway protocol is used for routing within an autonomous system network. Example:RIP, OSPF,...
24. EGP - Exterior Gateway Protocol is used for routing between two or more autonomous system networks. Example:BGP.
25. Access control list (ACL) - a list of rules that specifies which users or systems are granted or denied access to a particular object or system resource.
